# Roller Coaster Exploration

This project involves an exploratory analysis of a dataset containing information about roller coasters. The dataset includes details such as coaster name, location, status, manufacturer, opening year, geographical coordinates, main coaster type, opening date, speed, height, inversions, and G-force.

## Dataset Cleaning

To focus on relevant features, the dataset was cleaned, and the following columns were selected for analysis:

- Coaster_Name
- Location
- Status
- Manufacturer
- Opened
- Year_Introduced
- Latitude
- Longitude
- Type_Main
- Opening_Date_Clean
- Speed_mph
- Height_ft
- Inversions
- Gforce

## Exploratory Data Analysis

The analysis included visualizations, data exploration, and answering specific questions. The main question addressed was:

### What are the locations with the fastest roller coasters (minimum of 10)?

To answer this question, the following steps were taken:

1. **Data Cleaning:** The dataset was cleaned, and irrelevant columns were removed to focus on the necessary features.

2. **Visualization:** Various visualizations were created to explore relationships between different features. These visualizations helped identify patterns and trends.

3. **Question Analysis:** The analysis focused on identifying locations with the fastest roller coasters. The criterion was a minimum of 10 roller coasters in a location.

4. **Answer:** The locations with the fastest roller coasters were determined based on speed. The analysis considered coasters with a minimum speed of 10 for accuracy.

## Conclusion

This exploratory analysis provided insights into the dataset, allowing for the identification of locations with the fastest roller coasters. The analysis can serve as a foundation for more in-depth studies or specific inquiries related to roller coasters and amusement parks.

Feel free to explore the code and visualizations within the project to gain a comprehensive understanding of the findings. If you have any further questions or suggestions, please reach out.
